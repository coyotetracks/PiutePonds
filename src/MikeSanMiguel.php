  <p class="style9">Special update July 16, 2010. After hearing of the passing of Mike San Miguel, we are posting this tribute:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style9">&quot;Mike  San Miguel, worked tirelessly as a main member of the Friends for  Piute Wetlands as Piute Ponds struggled through its darkest hour.  He  contributed enormously to the knowledge of this marsh. His friends miss  him already.&quot;</p>

  <p class="style9">There is much to say about Mike and his contributions to Piute Ponds. This page will be updated as we find more images and information to post, so check back soon.</p>
  <p class="style9">A posting to various birding groups:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p class="style9">Birders,   </p>
    <p class="style9">News  is now getting out of a terrible tragedy. Mike San Miguel was killed yesterday  evening in a fall down a steep cliff while performing owl surveys in the San  Gabriel Mountains. He was 70 years old.</p>
    <p class="style9">This  is incredibly difficult to write, because I'm writing about the loss of a good  friend as well as a beloved fixture in the birding community. The very early  call this morning from Jon Feenstra should have been about a really good bird,  but instead it brought devastating news. And somehow it isn't any comfort to  know that Mike died working hard doing one of the things he loved most -  birding with a purpose. <br />
      Most  of you are familiar with Mike's accomplishments in the world of field ornithology.  He was a long-time bird bander with a bug for gathering good bird data. He was  an extraordinary connoisseur of rare birds, finding a great many of them and  enjoying trips all over California to chase them. His experience and talent  earned him a place for several years on the California Bird Records Committee,  and he was one of the best ambassadors the Committee ever had. He served  Western Field Ornithologists in many important capacities, culminating in a  several year stint as President during which the organization gained new vibrancy  and scope. He had an important role in the production of the CBRC's book  &quot;Rare Birds of California&quot; and published several papers in WFO's  journal Western Birds. He embraced eBird with unbridled enthusiasm (...he did  so much with unbridled enthusiasm) and has entered more eBird data from  California (4245 checklists) than almost any other individual as well as  editing submissions from several counties. He did a heroic amount of field work  and paperwork for the Los Angeles Breeding Bird Atlas and other large-scale  data gathering projects. In short, Mike was not only about the most active  birder I have ever known, but he was also the most enthusiastic birder - he  loved being in the field whether alone or with his many friends, and he enjoyed  learning something new every outing. </p>
    <p class="style9">But  I can hardly think about Mike the birder right now, because birding was only  his second passion. Mike was the consummate family man, and the love he and  Gayle showed so openly and generously for each other was nothing short of inspirational.  His son Michael (also one of California's most accomplished birders) and  daughter Lisa were everything to Mike, and if he wasn't the world's greatest  grandfather he was certainly in the running for that title. Many birders don't  realize that Mike virtually stopped birding for many years to be the best  possible father to his growing children, and even after he resumed birding with  more zeal and passion than ever he was always talking about his children and,  eventually, grandchildren. </p>
    <p class="style9">Those  who knew Mike well, and a great many who didn't, were keenly aware of Mike's  tireless work for bird and wildlife habitat conservation. We all try to be good  conservationists, and we're all keenly aware of the problems birds and their  habitats face. On my countless wonderful trips in the field with Mike the  conversation would inevitably turn, and pretty quickly, to the inexorable loss  of bird habitats as urban areas continued to grow and consume the places we  enjoyed going. I would gripe and curse and feel generally pessimistic about everything,  but Mike had a different and much more effective approach - he got involved. If  he enjoyed birding in an area, he felt it was his responsibility to work as  hard as he could to make sure it was preserved or restored for birds and  birders. His career working in environmental work for Southern California  Edison no doubt had a positive impact on southern California habitats. His  efforts for bird habitat at Piute Ponds, the San Gabriel River, and so many  other areas we take for granted have been heroic. His battles with agencies  that were damaging habitat were fought with fervor but also with grace - even  the Army Corps of Engineers must have had great respect for Mike. When Mike had  a conservation mission he was almost unstoppable, and the world is much better  for that passion of his. </p>
    <p class="style9">We've  lost so many birding friends to tragic accidents over the years, but this one  is almost unbearable. I knew Mike for forty years, and I've rarely enjoyed  anybody's company as much as his. To Gayle, and to Michael and Lisa, and to  Jake and Alex, I can't imagine the pain you're going through now and I hope  these few thoughts bring you at least some comfort. To Jon Feenstra - you were  such a great friend to Mike and I hope the weight of the tragedy that happened  while you and Mike were doing your owl surveys is lessened slightly by knowing  you were there as a friend and performed an incredible service in dealing with  a horrific situation. </p>
    <p class="style9">Mike  loved so many good things in life - as well as good people - that I'll be reminded  of him constantly. Watching the hummingbirds in my yard, following the annual  demise of the Dodgers, hearing about that next rare bird, seeing the trees and  shrubs he has nurtured in so many places mature and thrive, enjoying a meal.  How could I not think of Mike. And right now, Mike's passion for really good  wine seems like an appropriate way to honor him - I think I'll open a good one  from Paso Robles and toast one of the most generous and enjoyable people I have  ever met. I'll miss you, Mike! </p>
