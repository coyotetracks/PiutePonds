Piute Ponds now has a discussion forum
Hello ${FIRST_NAME},
 
We are excited to announce the enhanced Friends of Piute Ponds website (www.piuteponds.org) with a discussion forum.  This gives everyone a place to express and share their ideas about the ponds.
 
We added a few discussion topics to get things started, but feel free to add your own.  This forum is intended for fans to talk about anything regarding the wetlands.  Share whatever you want.  We are interested in what is on your mind.
 
Get engaged and make this your community.  Find people to connect with or let us know how you think the ponds are developing.
 
We just launched this forum and we are contacting all registered Friends of Piute Ponds members of the website to give you first access.
 
The direct link to the forums is (www.piuteponds.org/smf)
 
To contribute in the forums you will need to create a login.  Unfortunately, we are unable to reuse the login you have created for the main Piute Ponds website.
 
If you have trouble logging in please email me at help@piuteponds.org.
 
Enjoy and have fun,
Piute Ponds Website Team
