Friends of Piute Ponds

Some of the Friends have worked with Edwards Air Force Base and set up a tour of the ponds.  Now many Friends have toured the ponds already but this tour would be a walking tour, early in the day, and have someone from Edwards lead it and explaining what was done historically (especially last year), what results, if any, have been seen already, where are the ponds headed in the future.  This will give us some face time to ask questions or let the base know what the Friends think.  Let us know if you would like to go, space is limited.  The tour is scheduled for June 1 at 8:00 am.   Some of us thought we would like to go out a little early, say sunrise, find a spot to just sit still and watch what happens.  If things are slow we could go to Wayside Café for breakfast before the 8:00 tour.

Contact social@PiutePonds.org if you would like to go.   The bases typical access letter will not be required for this tour since we will have a tour guide, and for our early morning sit - we'll have someone who has a letter with us if needed.

Look forward to hearing from you!
