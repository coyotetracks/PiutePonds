Hi From Piute Ponds.  We Have Moved.
Dear ${FIRST_NAME} ${LAST_NAME}:

As some of you have noticed the PiutePonds.com site has been down for a few days. We've changed the URL to PiutePonds.org. The only change is the .org on the end.

We haven't quite got the redirecting function working yet to direct anyone looking for the .com site to the .org site.

If you or someone you know, registered as a new member or changed a password in the past 2 weeks, please do it again on the .org site.

If you have issues with the website, please send them to help@piuteponds.org.

As punishment for our mistake, we are not accepting our annual bonus. LOL.

Best regards,
The Website Team
