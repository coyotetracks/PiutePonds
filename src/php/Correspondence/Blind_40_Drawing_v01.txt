${FIRST_NAME},

There is a wew process for Blind 40

You do not have to own a blind to be part of this drawing.

Anyone who wants to be in a drawing for blind 40 on Sundays must email blinds@piuteponds.org the week of the drawing. Everyone who emails to be in the drawing has their name dropped in a "hat" and drawn on Friday at 4pm. The winner of blind 40 includes both partners. If the individual(s) have a normal blind it becomes available for other hunters. Call Mark after 4:00 on Fri, 661.433.9956 or 661.277.1418 if you want the "hunter's normal blind" that is vacant (if there is one). To witness the drawing visit us at building 4231.
