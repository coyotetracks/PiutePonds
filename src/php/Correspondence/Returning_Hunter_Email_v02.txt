Welcome Back to Friends of Piute Ponds Website
Dear ${FIRST_NAME} ${LAST_NAME}:

Welcome back to PiutePonds.org.  Our purpose is spreading the word about Piute Ponds and increasing utilization for everyone.

You have been set up as a hunter on the site.  As a hunter you can view the duck blind list on the web site. To do this, go to www.PiutePonds.org, login with the email address and password you used when you registered, and click on the “HUNTING” button on the left side of the page. The Hunting page will appear.  At the bottom of the page is a link called “Duck Blind List”

Just like last year you will be able to report your hunts and the number of ducks you have harvested by following instructions on the Hunting page.

The ponds have undergone an extensive overhaul.   New ponds have been added and a lot of work has been done to add weirs, culverts, and deep channels.  The water has recently been replenished.  Come take a look.

Check the hunter page for updates. Conditions are changing quickly.

Feel free to call Edwards for more information 661-277-1418 for Mark Hagan or 661-810-9622 for Wanda Deal, or contact your Ponds Managers Richard Paquette and Steve Walden (see blind list for phone numbers).  Call for combination.

If you have any problems please let us know at help@PiutePonds.org

Thank you,
Piute Ponds Website Team
